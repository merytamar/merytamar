### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mery

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about exploring the vast possibilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they can transform the way we interact with technology. 

## ðŸ’» My Interests

- I'm deeply interested in developing concepts related to Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Currently, I'm following courses on DataCamp to explore various LLM applications, always eager to learn more and push the boundaries of what's possible.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning

- As I journey through my learning path on DataCamp, I'm gaining hands-on experience with real-world LLM applications, understanding their potential and limitations.
- I'm committed to continuous learning, always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow my expertise in the field of LLMs.

## ðŸ“š Projects and Contributions

**Predicting Protein Structures with High Accuracy** 

By leveraging the latest advancements in LLMs, I'm working towards developing a tool that can predict protein structures more efficiently, potentially accelerating drug discovery and our understanding of biological processes.
